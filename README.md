# Next Word Predictor

This project is a next-word prediction model built using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with TensorFlow. It leverages the "Salesforce/wikitext" dataset, specifically "wikitext-103-raw-v1," to train a deep learning model capable of predicting the next word based on given text input.


## Features

* Utilizes LSTM for sequence prediction.

* Pre-trained on a large text corpus (WikiText-103) for better contextual understanding.

* Built with TensorFlow and Keras for efficient training and inference.

* Tokenization and text processing handled via TensorFlow's text utilities.

* Provides real-time next-word suggestions.
## Dataset

I used the "wikitext-103-raw-v1" dataset from "Salesforce/wikitext," which contains high-quality, clean Wikipedia articles for language modeling tasks. This dataset is well-suited for text prediction as it offers a diverse and structured vocabulary.t
## Note

This project is intended to showcase practical knowledge of sequence modeling using LSTM networks for natural language processing tasks. Training the model for additional epochs may yield improved prediction accuracy.
